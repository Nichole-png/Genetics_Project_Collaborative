In this module, you will learn about the gene for ATP synthase 6 and how this protein is involved in human disease.  The subunit 6 of ATP synthase is the subunit that forms the transmembrane domain of ATP synthase (also referred to as subunit c which forms the proton channel, F$_{0}$).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["You can review with the following book section."],"metadata":{"id":"k1OkpzrrJF-u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**To view the reading, click on the next cell and hit SHIFT+ENTER on your keyboard**"],"metadata":{"id":"fheBLq9oVjGY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from IPython.display import IFrame\n","IFrame('https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRE-fJerQLSvqYoe-Kq9RyNo3q3c5Wtx/preview', width=600, height=300)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":321},"id":"1CNzloDeJOU9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1640210855495,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":166,"user":{"displayName":"Nichole Orench-Rivera","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjq8Kc4Nz6yFdhqc7Q95avhy5U1hIVD3wqGdvg4Gw=s64","userId":"04478964316861456821"}},"outputId":"18d497f9-b68c-4be2-ca22-16324d28926b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","        <iframe\n","            width=\"600\"\n","            height=\"300\"\n","            src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRE-fJerQLSvqYoe-Kq9RyNo3q3c5Wtx/preview\"\n","            frameborder=\"0\"\n","            allowfullscreen\n","        ></iframe>\n","        "],"text/plain":["<IPython.lib.display.IFrame at 0x7f32edf58fd0>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Research the ATP synthase using a patient's mDNA sequence and determine what is wrong (if anything) with the synthase of the patient.
