It is the target of the family of statin drugs, which have become very important in the treatment of high cholesterol and reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease in many people.  In this module, you will learn about the gene for HMG-CoA reductase, how statins inhibit this enzyme, and how this enzyme is involved in cholesterol homeostasis.\n","\n","Many individuals who are currently taking statins have been diagnosed with “familial hypercholesterolemia”.  In this module, you will also be learning about this condition, its genetic basis, and why inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is important to the treatment of this condition.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Examine a cDNA sequence froma patient that is completely unresponsive to statin therapy.
