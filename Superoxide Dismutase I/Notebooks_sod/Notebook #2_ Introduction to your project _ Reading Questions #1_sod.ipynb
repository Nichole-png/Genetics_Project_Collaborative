It is a series of events in a cell that lead to its self-destruction.  Apoptosis is a natural and important process that allows a cell to cleanly destroy itself when the cell senses an uncorrectable problem.  The types of cell problems that lead to apoptosis range from an increase in reactive oxygen species (for example, superoxide ion) to uncontrolled cellular growth.   The process of apoptosis leads a cell to degrade itself and its parts to be engulfed and destroyed by surrounding cells.  Apoptosis can provide a clean get-away for a damaged cell and prevent surrounding cells from being damaged.  The signaling pathways and cellular conditions that lead to apoptosis are still being determinedSuper. oxide dismutase is an enzyme that is important to cells for converting potentially damaging free radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.  A form of this enzyme is found in mitochondria to scavenge any superoxide molecules that escape from Complex IV during oxidative phosphorylation.  Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene cause the disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), also called Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Determine if your patient has a mutation related to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS).
