It is a series of events in a cell that lead to its self-destruction.  Apoptosis is a natural and important process that allows a cell to cleanly destroy itself when the cell senses an incorrectable problem.  The types of cell problems that lead to apoptosis range from an increase in reactive oxygen species (for example, superoxide ion) to uncontrolled cellular growth.   The process of apoptosis leads a cell to degrade itself and its parts to be engulfed and destroyed by surrounding cells.  Apoptosis can provide a clean get-away for a damaged cell and prevent surrounding cells from being damaged.  The signaling pathways and cellular conditions that lead to apoptosis are still being determined.  Some disease states, like cancer, have been linked to decreases in apoptosis in certain cells.  Other disease states, like Lou Gehrig's disease, have been linked to increases in apoptosis in certain cells.\n","Caspases are thiol proteases and are important players in apoptosis. They are involved in the signaling pathway and each degrade specific proteins.  Caspase-1 was the first caspase to be characterized and was previously named interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) after its protein substrate.  Increases in caspase-1 activity has been linked to Lou Gehrig's disease."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Work with a patient’s cDNA sequence.
