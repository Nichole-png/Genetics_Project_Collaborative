The transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell can result from many causes.  In one model, factors that lead to an increased rate of mutation in DNA increases the chances that a proto-oncogene will be mutated into an oncogene, causing a normal cell to be transformed into a cancerous cell.   \n","\n","Some research has shown an increased incidence for lung cancer in smokers who have a particular polymorphic version of the gene for cytochrome P450 1A1 that is expressed in the cells that line their lungs.\n","Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is an enzyme that oxidizes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  The basic mechanism that has been proposed is that this enzyme converts aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke into more toxic compounds that can modify DNA and that this leads to a higher rate of mutation in the cells that line the lungs."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Examine one gene, cytochrome P450, that has been proposed to be a risk factor for lung cancer.
