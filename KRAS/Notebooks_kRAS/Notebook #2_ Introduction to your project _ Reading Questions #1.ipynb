The transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell can result from many causes. In one model, factors that lead to\n","an increased rate of mutation in DNA increases the chances that a protooncogene will be mutated into an oncogene, causing a normal cell to be transformed into a cancerous cell."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1df7f14c"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","In this project, you will:\n","\n","* Examine one proto-oncogene, K-Ras that has been associated with many cancers, including lung cancer.
