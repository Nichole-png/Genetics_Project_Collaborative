# Genetics_Project_Collaborative
This is a Google Colab adaptation of Dr. April Bednarski's project 'Studying the Genetic Basis of Disease Using Web-Based Bioinformatics Tools' found here: https://community.gep.wustl.edu/gepweb/bio3055/bio3055.html.

There are a total of eight topics, each with a folder with all the Notebooks and a folder of project files.
Both folders need to be in the same location within your Google Drive for the Notebook exercises to run properly.

**Instructions:**
> STEP 1: Make a folder in your Google Drive called Genetics_Project

> STEP 2: Access this repository and choose a project topic (enzyme of choice)

> STEP 3: Download the folders to your computer and unzip them

> STEP 4: Upload them to the Google Drive folder you created in STEP 1.

> STEP 5: Start working through the Notebooks*


*The Tutorial Notebook #1 was obtained/adapted from: https://colab.research.google.com/github/data-psl/lectures2020/blob/master/notebooks/01_python_basics.ipynb.
